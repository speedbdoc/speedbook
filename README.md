# About

Speedb is a library that provides persistent key-value store.&#x20;

Keys and values are arbitrary byte arrays. The keys are ordered within the key-value store according to a user-specified comparator function.\
\
This open-source project, which is maintained by Speedb, is forked from RocksDB, which was developed by Facebook.

Speedb features several important and ongoing improvements, which will be documented as they are released.&#x20;

The Speedb community is open to developers around the world who want to contribute to this project, including code, documentation, and helping to find and report issues.&#x20;
